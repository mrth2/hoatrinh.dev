I proudly hail from Haiphong, a beautiful port city in Vietnam overflowing with culture and opportunity. In 2008, I took a leap of faith and moved to the lively capital of Hanoi to pursue an exhilarating university experience. My high school focus on Informatics and my Computer Science degree ignited a deep passion for programming and product development. Graduating was merely the first step in my journey; each day offers an excellent opportunity to grow and enhance my skills, inspiring me to innovate and create enthusiastically and purposefully!
