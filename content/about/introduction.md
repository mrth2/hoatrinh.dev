I am a **WordPress Speed Expert** - if you have wanted to build fast WordPress pages or own slow WordPress sites, join my world. I upgrade hundreds of websites from 7-8s loading to 2-3s. By understanding the core web vitals, with the quality of coding in mind, I satisfied many site owners. Who doesn't want a fast-loading web which can bring **many sales** and **improve life**? Are you?

While WordPress Optimization is my audit, Full Stack Developer is the reason I was born. I specialized with Laravel, PHP, NodeJS, VueJS, NuxtJS, TailwindCSS, Bootstrap, Strapi, and ElectronJS. I dedicate myself to making fast web & native applications that are well-structured, scalable, and testable. I'm a fast learner, hard worker, and team player who is proficient in the world of web. I always put customer satisfaction in my mind, so it's always a win-win working with me!
